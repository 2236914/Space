    [description] => At sa paglisan ng araw, akala'y 'di ka mahal
At ang nadarama'y hindi magtatagal
Malay ko bang hindi magpapagal
Iibigin kita kahit ga'no pa katagal
Tumingin ka sa 'king mga mata
At hindi mo na kailangan pang
Magtanong nang paulit-ulit
Ikaw lang ang iniibig .... At sa paglisan ng araw, akala'y 'di ka mahal
At ang nadarama'y hindi magtatagal
Malay ko bang hindi magpapagal
Iibigin kita kahit ga'no pa katagal

    [description] => 'Today was an absolutely fantastic day. I woke up feeling refreshed and ready to tackle any challenges that came my way. The sun was shining brightly, and there was a gentle breeze that made the weather perfect. I spent the morning working on a project that I am truly passionate about, and everything seemed to flow effortlessly. In the afternoon, I met up with some friends for lunch, and we had a great time catching up and sharing stories. The food was delicious, and the company was even better. Later in the evening, I went for a walk in the park, enjoying the beautiful scenery and reflecting on how grateful I am for all the positive things in my life. Overall, it was a day filled with joy, laughter, and meaningful moments that I will cherish.
